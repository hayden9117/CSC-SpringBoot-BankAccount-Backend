# CSC-SpringBoot-BankAccount-Backend


# WhyI built the application

This was a simple college project I did for programming II. The assignment was to build a Bankaccount parent class and a checking account child class to demonstrate inheritance. The second portion of the assignment wanted us to build a program wich demonstrated CRUD like features. I used this as an opprtunity to learn a bit about springboot.
